I finally bit the bullet and did it. I have always thought about make a blog but I was never really sure where to start. I thought about making my own blogging framework-of-sorts using SvelteKit and a markdown parser. However, I do not have enough dedication to do that.

Then today I thought about it some more and almost fully committed to using Ruby on Rails. Which would be completely overkill for what I need. Then I remembered that Jekyll exists and now we are here.

Still not completely sure about how Jekyll works but I am getting there.

## Update

Actually switched the blog over to [hugo](https://gohugo.io). Works better for me. Also ruby environment issues were really bothering me as a non ruby developer.
